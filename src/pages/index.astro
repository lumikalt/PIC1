            Space is attracting much interest from young students in the wake of
            the Newspace Revolution, the democratization of access to space by
            small companies, universities, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            This trend has exploded since the flight demonstration in 2003 of a
            1-liter satellite built by university students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Satellite launch costs have since dropped steadily, and a few
            thousand small satellites are already orbiting the Earth.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Plans</h2>

          <p>
            To challenge young students to see the electronics inside
            PocketQubes.
          </p>
          <p>
            To build a “Lego-style” PocketQube, where students can try out
            different combinations of sensors and their layouts, give commands
            via a computer as a ground station and see its effects.
          </p>
          <p>To make our PocketQube as cheap and user-friendly as possible.</p>
          <p>
            This DIY approach to sattelite design and operation will be a
            powerful educational tool to teach students about satellite
            electronics, systems integration, observing the effects of design
            choices, all while learning through interactive, practical
            experience.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Product</h2>

          <p>
            A 1L (10x10x10 cm) PocketQube satellite with a modular design and
            set-up instructions, designed for schools and universities to expose
            students to this engineering field, thus captivating the next
            generation of engineers, particularly interested in electronics or
            space.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Satellite contains microcontrollers, myriad sensors
            (temperature, pressure, magnetometer, gyroscope, camera), power
            generation via solar panels, and a communication system to send data
            to the improvisd ground station, which can be built with a software
            defined radio and a simple antenna. It's modular, so that layers can
            be swapped out to test different sensor combinations and
            applications.
