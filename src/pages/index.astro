            Space is attracting much interest from young students in the wake of
            the Newspace Revolution, the democratization of access to space by
            small companies, universities, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            This trend has exploded since the flight demonstration in 2003 of a
            1-liter satellite built by university students.
          </p>
          <p>
            Satellite launch costs have since dropped steadily, and a few
            thousand small satellites are already orbiting the Earth.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Plans</h2>

          <p>
            To challenge young students to see the electronics inside
            PocketQubes.
          </p>
          <p>
            To build a “Lego-style” PocketQube, where students can try out
            different combinations of sensors and their layouts, give commands
            via a computer as a ground station and see its effects.
          </p>
          <p>To make our PocketQube as cheap and user-friendly as possible.</p>
